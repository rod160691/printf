Task 0: I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life (mandatory)
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...); Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings) Write output to stdout, the standard output stream. format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

%c: for printing characters

%s: for printing strings

%%: for printing the '%' character

You don't have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function. You don't have to handle the flag characters, field width, precision, or the length modifiers.

Task 1: Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't (mandatory)
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

%d: for printing integers

%i: for printing integers

You don't have to handle the flag characters, field width, precision, or the length modifiers.
